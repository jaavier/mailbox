# What is this?
This is a small project to continue practicing with Typescript and TailwindCSS. I love to learn by doing, so I started to create a mailbox inspired in Gmail design. 

This project could be used with other purposes, like project managment, ticket managment and your imagination is the limit!

Still under construction. Feel free to contribute :)
